# Udacity_Wine_EDA
Project 4 for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree  
Data Analysis with R course

## Description
The assignment was to document a stream-of-consciousness style analysis of a dataset and
create visualizations to explore trends and relationships. I chose this dataset from 
Udacity's recommendations and intend to add a similar analysis of the red wine dataset
and compare the two.

## Files
- The Rmd file contains all code, visualizations, and discussion.  
- The html file is the final report, including visualizations and discussion, but no code.  
- The csv files contain the raw data, and the txt file has descriptions of the variables  
- The pdf is a larger version of one of the visualizations
